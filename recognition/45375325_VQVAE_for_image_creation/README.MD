# VQ-VAE for creation of images using the OASIS Brain Dataset

***

This is my implementation of the vector quantised variable auto encoder (<https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00937>).

I used [this implementation](https://github.com/MishaLaskin/vqvae) by [MishaLaskin](https://github.com/MishaLaskin/) as inspiration to gain an understanding of how the code works
